inspirational leader in IT**

« Lucien
Engelen, dares to put the patient fully central place within the care process,
actually as partners
in their own care. Within the Nijmegen hospital leadership he exemplifies the
so-called REshape-way,
that combines both people and ideas and uses technologies to glue those
together. Although
he works with a small core team, his organically way of organizing and
disruption of existing
processes is energizing.He is an
inspiration for all : stakeholders: patients and their families,
doctors, nurses, students and policymakers. "It's
not about me, nor my team. Together, there are thousands of us", said
Engelen ".A striking initiative
is their ecosystem Hereismydata. Together with Philips and with the help of
cloud software provider
Salesforce they developed a combination of a personal health record, an online community,
as well as connectivity platform for medical equipment, wearables and apps,
together with
patients and their social circle. A great example of stimulating an 'patient
engagement in the care
process. Lucien Engelen doesn't innovate to make money; the innovative spirit
to improve the health
of many prevails. It is also a bold statement: a hospital patient that actually
dares to approach
the patient as a partner.»
