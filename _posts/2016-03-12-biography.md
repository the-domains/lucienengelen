so-called REshape-way,
that combines both people and ideas and uses technologies to glue those
together. Although
he works with a small core team, his organically way of organizing and
disruption of existing
processes is energizing.He is an
inspiration for all : stakeholders: patients and their families,
doctors, nurses, students and policymakers. "It's
not about me, nor my team. Together, there are thousands of us", said
Engelen ".A striking initiative
is their ecosystem Hereismydata. Together with Philips and with the help of
cloud software provider

as well as connectivity platform for medical equipment, wearables and apps,
together with
patients and their social circle. A great example of stimulating an 'patient
